# Seismic-Inversion-on-edge-devices-
In this project, efficient seismic inversion models are designed to reconstruct subsuurface velocities. The code is implemented on a resource limited device like raspberry pi to perform inversion within allowable inference time. A user friendly GUI application is designed to automate the model execution and inversion on the raspberry pi
